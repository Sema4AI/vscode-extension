## Sema4.ai VS Code extension

> Note: The `Sema4.ai` extension fro VS Code will replace the [Robocorp Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robocorp.robocorp-code) -extension. The same features exist in this extension, so you can just switch to using `Sema4.ai`. Future development will be focused here.

The Sema4.ai extension makes it easy to create Python based automation projects and AI Actions.

It can be used to scale up from simple image fetching or API calling all the way to complex process enterprise automation workflows.

Main features include:

-   **Create, run and debug AI Actions** - Sema4.ai AI Actions provides end-to-end stack supporting every type of connection between AI and your apps and data. You are in control where to run the code and everything is built for easiness, security, and scalability. 

-   **Automatic configuration of dependencies** - Every Python oriented project uses its own lightweight virtual environment and runs in isolation.

-   **Inspector for Web, Windows Application Elements & more** - Pick elements from different mediums and create locators for automation

-   **Create, run and debug projects** - Do these with ease while developing Tasks to automate applications

-   **Deploy projects to Control Room** - Run unattended automation in a safe, reliable and easy to use Cloud Platform.

> Note: the use of cloud-based orchestration in [Control Room](https://cloud.robocorp.com/) requires a free account.
