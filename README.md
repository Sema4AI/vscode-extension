# What is this repo?

This repo contains utilities meant to be vendored in other places.

In this repo, **only relative imports** to other modules are allowed.

Also, it should work without any external deps (so, if external libraries
are required, a fallback should be provided if it's not found).

# Places where it's used:

Vendoring happens at the `robocorp` repo.

So, at the robo root it was added as:

```
git subtree add --prefix action_server/src/robocorp/action_server/vendored_deps git@github.com:robocorp/vendored_deps.git master --squash
```

And it can be updated (again, at the robo root) with:

```
git subtree pull --prefix action_server/src/robocorp/action_server/vendored_deps git@github.com:robocorp/vendored_deps.git master --squash
```
